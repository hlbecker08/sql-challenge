# sql-challenge

This is an analysis of a businesses employees and departments. Code for the analysis can be found in the EmployeeSQL folder. Tables are loaded in the order written in the SQL code with the file table_schema.sql. Once those are created the data can be imported in, in the same order that the tables were created, from the folder data. All questions for this challenge are answered in the queries.sql file and an ERD screenshot can be found in the file ERD image.

I worked with Conner Dekok on this challenge as well as referenced Yara El-Emam for the table_schema.
